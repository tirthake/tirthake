# 👋 Hi, I’m Tirtha Das

Welcome to my GitHub! I’m a passionate programmer with a detail-oriented mindset and a love for building modular, efficient, and clean code. Whether it's refining logic, mastering algorithms, or experimenting with visuals, I’m always pushing the boundaries of what I can create and learn.


## 🚀 Projects and Interests

- 🔧 **Modular Programming in C** – Practicing clean structure with functions and prototypes.
- 📐 **Algorithms** – Kruskal, Prim, and the logic behind each.
- 🧠 **Truth Tables & Logic Analysis** – From tautologies to contradictions.
- 🌐 **Image Enhancement & Aesthetic Tuning** – Bringing tech and creativity together.
- 🎙️ **Exploring Podcasting** – Sharing thoughts and stories in a new format.

## ⚽ Off the Keyboard

When I’m not coding, I’m lacing up my pads for practice, refining my skills as a batter, or dissecting plays like a strategist. I also enjoy diving deep into the English languAGE—whether it’s grammar precision or crafting thoughtful phrases.
